# VK-pro--and-anti-feminist
This repository contains the code and econometric analysis for studying gender inequality through social media data in Russia. The research leverages VKontakte group memberships to classify users into feminist and anti-feminist categories.


## How did we get the group lists?
Firstly, I read this [article](https://web.archive.org/web/20231205130246/https://feministeerium.ee/ru/nekotorye-vpechatleniya-o-feministskih/) and extracted the feminist group names out of it. The resulting list of group names and their id's (some autogenerated using python) are in the [FEM groups (article) file](FEM groups VK (статья) (2).xlsx)

Additionally, I loaded the top 10k groups (with the most subs as of 2018) and semi-manually chose the fem/anti-fem groups. The resulting list of groups (ids and some basic characteristics) are contained in the [FEM groups file](FEM groups (2).xlsx)

Ended up using only the groups from the article after filtering out the ones that are region-specific or are not open to the public the file with the groups and some metadata [Cleaned up FEM groups (article)](More info on the fem groups from the article.xlsx)


## Finding group subs...
Using pickles files [The big folder 17_01_18](collected_17_01_18/) I checked how many subs do our groups have and saved the info into [a pickle file](group_users_just_fem.pkl). I merged this sub info with user characteristics and exported into [an excel file](user|group just FEM subs.xlsx).
